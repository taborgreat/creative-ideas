# Treefficiency v2.0 – Grow the Life You Mean to Live

## 🌱 Introduction

**Treefficiency** is an AI-powered goal-building and self-organization system rooted in your _core values_. It helps you grow a digital tree of your ambitions, habits, reflections, and actions — and lets you _live through it_.

With **LLM integration** in v2.0, Treefficiency becomes more than a tool: it’s your **Tree-Builder Agent**, breaking down confusion, planning based on your root motivations, and helping you analyze your life over time.

## 🌳 What's New in v2.0?

### 🧠 Integrated LLM Support

- **Plan anything** — from brushing your teeth to building a startup — step-by-step, with adaptive levels of detail.
- **Break down confusion** with real-time clarification, branching deeper whenever needed.
- **Converse** with your tree: Ask it about past habits, performance metrics, or how to get back on track.
- **Get personalized suggestions** based on your actual goals and history.

### 🌲 Tree-Based Memory & Understanding

- All data — goals, notes, schedule, habits, reflections — grows as a **hierarchically-structured tree**.
- The LLM uses your tree to **understand you contextually**, referencing prior steps, values, and outcomes to guide your future.
- Every new plan or insight builds on your past — reinforcing your personal philosophy over time.

---

## 🌿 Core Philosophy

> Most of our efforts are scattered — spontaneous reactions, unanchored dreams, or impulsive attempts at improvement.

**Treefficiency flips the script.**

Start with your **root value** — like `Creating`, `Learning`, or `Serving`. From that, every branch (goal, plan, habit) grows in service of that value. It’s _you_, but structured.

---

## 🧰 Key Features

### 🪴 Build from Root Values

- Define your _most important personal value_
- Build all goals and plans as branches that stem from this root

## 🤖 AI Tree-Builder Agent

Ask:

> "Help me plan to brush my teeth"

The LLM builds a step-by-step tree:

- Wake up
- Walk to sink
- Get toothbrush
- Put toothpaste
- Brush
- Rinse

Get stuck on a step? Just ask:

> "What does 'get ready to brush' mean?"

The LLM will expand that node into sub-steps:

- Walk to bathroom
- Turn on light
- Locate toothbrush...

- Every step can be _simple or abstract_ — your choice

### 🗂️ Tree-to-Todo Conversion

Your 3D tree of goals, tasks, and reflections isn't just for browsing — it's actionable.

The **TreeBuilder automatically distills active branches into adaptive todo lists**, showing only the next relevant step from any branch you're working on.

✅ Biteable tasks  
✅ Updated in real-time  
✅ Reflective of both planning and progress

This ensures your system evolves with you — offering the **clarity of a todo list** with the **depth of a personal ontology**.

> Think: your mind as a tree, your day as its leaves.

### 📝 Schedule, Reflect, Iterate

- Schedule steps or full plans with time-based reminders
- Reflect on completed tasks (e.g., “Brush gums less hard”)
- Agent logs your notes and updates future reminders accordingly

### 📊 Analyze Your Life Tree

Ask questions like:

- “How much was I lifting last April–May?”
- “What were my calories and weight back then?”
- “How does that compare to now?”

Treefficiency compares data over time and gives tailored advice:

- “Here’s how to return to your peak performance...”

### 🛠 Trim, Grow, Optimize

- Remove branches that no longer serve your root value
- Expand branches that yield high returns
- Let the tree evolve dynamically as you do

## 🌐 Future Scope

### 🔒 Tree-Based Browser Control (v3.0+)

- Treefficiency as a **value-aligned web browser layer**

### 🧬 OS-Level Motivation Layer (v4.0+)

- Turn Treefficiency into a **goal-driven operating environment**
- Control computer use based on goals/motivation
- Agent acts as a bridge between your intentions and your machine

| System Type                            | Limitations                                                | Treefficiency Advantage                                                 |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Task/Habit Managers (e.g. Todoist)     | Linear, list-based, no values integration                  | Hierarchical, value-rooted, dynamically branching                       |
| Mind Maps / PKM Tools (e.g. Notion)    | Manual structure, lacks AI, not goal-aware                 | AI-assisted, reflection-aware, goal/context memory via LLM              |
| AI Journals / Coaches (e.g. Reflectly) | Journal-style, mood-tracking, no deep planning             | Plan-builder + scheduler + reflection system in one                     |
| GTD/PKM Hybrids                        | Powerful but require tedious manual setup and maintenance  | Grows _with you_, evolves through conversation and updates              |
| AI Planning Assistants (e.g. Motion)   | Schedule-focused, task-centric, not personal growth rooted | Life-wide, value-centric, with long-term reflection and habit evolution |

## 🚀 Get Started

1. Define your **root value** (e.g. Creating)
2. Ask your Tree-Builder:  
   `“Help me create a fitness plan”`  
   `“How should I manage time today to write more?”`
3. Schedule, reflect, refine.
4. Watch your tree grow — and with it, your clarity.
