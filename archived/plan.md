the root node is active and is primarily used to track time spent, and make time goals
time is the root value of the tree, meaning all other values depend on its credit which is why
all branches originate from it. you only get so many hours a day to spend through your root
so having the optimized value exchanges throughout will help grow other values with same amount of time
its all about finding how to use your time to get the most value back by managing your value trades
and creative planning structure, trimming off frictionous or completely offcourse strategies for time

Every node/creative idea must be quantifiable that can be set to a goal to be completed based on inherited values, or must be able to say yes or no if it’s done as a whole.

only unquatifiable ones are the banks/exchanges: the main branches: wealth, self (body/mind), others (people, art, materials)
(the fundamental qyantifuable creativevideas coming out of these should relate to the core idea as much as possible, even if
it starts to require values from other parent branches. this allows you to see the root motivations of your endeavors, and not get lost in the sauce
as they entangle and interconnect. )
	
these unquaitifable serve more as organisers for the children below, and act as "trade" hubs to debt values from branches if needed, and clearly see value exchange.
like a bank, they manage the values for all their users(children), and control  "prices" for value swaps depending
on the value the other bank has or is going for so you can see clearly if trades are fair

ex: self->body->2400 calories/day->requires $20 to buy food, which is debted off the wealth branch.
	youd to be careful not to have your $20 for food coming from wealth branch and debting into the body branch as time for wrking out
        as that would throw off the root value of why youre making $20 and create "floating" branches





from the hub of the main branches you can see what "weeds" are feeding for values from other endeavors
or in others->branches->car->you need to pay insurance you could debt wealth branch,
showing you are losing value from wealth branch to support value on other branch


	
If a quantifiable goal is repetitive and progressive (like weights in a lifting branch) then the branch prestoges each time it is satisfied, with a new goal set 

lets say in the other->material branch i write a main goal (quite stupidly) get a lamborghini
this idea would cross into othr branches instantly, as a major step could be acquire $1000000
this would have to creste a linked idea in the wealth branch, that needs to be satisfied for the
other branch to move forward. weeds/linked ideas are much the same, and can be connected by ref id and treated like a child
of the needy branch while using the values of the giving branch to value exchange.

Goal of app is to create focus on creating, and refining creations thoroughly. Hopefully it helps you stop everything you’ve been wanting to stop by starting everything you’ve been wanting to start.



Charles:

Day 1- trimmed tree off roof/house, light weeding 2 hrs
Day 2- mowed, edged, weeded, trimmed front bushes, cleaned doorstep/walkways/cobwebs 
Day 3- picked up dirt from Home Depot 2x$9.50 (sent $20 for it) , picked big werds out of grass, put dirt down carefully in empty spots, laid second layer seed $10 of seed, fertilized, cleaned weeds along fence and side of trailer, trimmed backyard bushes

Day 4- finished putting dirt/seed/weeding front yard (came back with final bag). Cleaned gutters. Chopped more trees in front 



How can I store pictures and words inside of a object that is in a database for like a note that has plans and is referenced by an id


Goals: get bark dust down so weeds stop growing around perimeter, make grass dense/weed free, get all plants trimmed to appropriate size, get all falls leaves out of there



Debt branch - from an outer branch , makes a branch into a parent branch above on another chain of branches, requiring value from that branch to fulfill it. Such as needing money for food in physical body branch, or needing to learn intellect in the intellect branch 

Or I could have weeds (from needing values across branches) that are all on the root feeding from different branches and taking resources from the tree but that won’t work because root doesn’t have all values so the weed will need to be on a branch that has the value . You connect need of value from from branch to a store of value on another transferring energy across branches


Every goal must be quantifiable that can be set to a goal to be completed, or must be able to say yes or no if it’s done.

If a quantifiable goal is repetitive and progressive (like weights in a lifting session) then the branch prestoges each time it is satisfied, with a new goal set 


Add date created property for nodes

Inside of object, it holds if it’s floating or set to a date (in variable direct time date or null)
 
. It also has a reeffect time of set to a date (in hours)

Prestige endpoint either updates to new generation (with new date adding hrs to set date, or stays floating if floating but reoccurring), or it closes the nodes and ends it if one time.


Work out with pharaoh 
Add node details section when you click a node In tree or schedule list

Node details shows the all the info, has buttons to edit the values and such, buttons to complete and prestige, and also an option to load the scheduler for that node or the branch structure out from it (having the node in details as parent)

Node details should also have an area to edit notes 


Add goal properties based off stored values/goal setting

Make a new node create a markup file
And reference the file to the node in the details

When prestiging the markup should add lines at top 

You should be able to edit the nodes notes in node detail

Switch from js object to storing in database

Reorganize front end into defined modules 


Add ability to weigh branch connections by values 

Add mycelium network to be able to allocate values across nodes, track it, and correlate it with node growth algorithmically to auto suggest transferring values to keep the branches stable and prevent over focus 


Add endpoint to add a node between two nodes, and reassign the parents, and also one to delete nodes in between and reassign the parents 



Tie a date to a creative idea to remind in that day, or let it be floating. 

Try to keep creative ideas as genuine as possible. The goal is to break free from algorithmic control and get your life direction and learning path back into where your mind wants to take it

seriousness level-dictates amount of free time rewarded daily 

Starts off very low, around 1 hr a day expected of creating. But each week it goes up until it’s around 5-8hrs a day. This will help slowly straighten out many people onto focused creative paths and free them of distractions as they find the fulfillment in bringing creations to life by learnjng and staying dedicated, and possibly the many rewards their creations bring to their lifes.

Goal: organize time and energy usage towards creating: turning any thought into reality, 

Promote amount of time focused on getting defined chosen contemplated ideas made into reality, and amount of time lesrning necessary things for that to happen, and try to prevent useless endeavors that have no use.  

Tracking creative ideas giving structure to record progress/notes/time spent, defining what is needed to be learnt, and calculating time spent creating to reward out leisure time. 

Daily reflections showing amount of lrogress done with how you felt (task manager of thought queue ) reflect at end of night on all your thoughts you had during day and calculates what thoughts/habits lead to creations and what thoughts/habits lead to loss of motivation and need to be worked on detaching from 
Time spent thinking about thought and time spent creating vs time spent not creating (find total create time at end of day and total time reported thinking about that thought). Each thought in task manager weighted over time to make sure it’s accurate that the thought is reason for creativity change 

Branch system

Creative ideas
Idea is anythin

Each node has its own section to write notes and keep track of time spent. The parent of each node keeps track of all the child time, ultimately leading to the original ancestor keeping track of all the time spent on the idea

Reoccurrent ideas vs one time building 
You add time/text to an idea when worked, and the amount of time. In process is yellow. Once finished, it turns green and time is finalized. The idea is moved the completed (made into physical reality from mind)
Serves as a diary to plan, organize ideas, and track time spent

Ideas can be as broad or defined as possible, but it’s best to keep them broad at the start to give yourself categories to work with. A good root will be the start of a good branch system. But it’s uo the to the user. Ultimately it all measures the same and is a matter of organization: whether you want broad or narrow contexts initially. But each node is an individual with its own notes, reflection section.

In between being creative, you will also have time to learn, and you will esrn time to ingest/play meaning watch tv or browse randomly after enough focus into creating has been completed. If you do not have the motivation to create or learn, you must sit and be still and rest until your mind finds an idea it wants to manifest. Do not go into distractions.

There will also be a mental task manager section that manages your off focused thoughts, like emotions, habits, etc, and help you track what’s limiting your creative energy and help you stay focused by understanding your habitual mental queue and deburdening the load. Once a problem is entered, it stays in the list. Each day you can put how much of each thing you thought about (adding if not there) and also track your different emotions (it will track time spent fulfilling creative ideas compared to the emotions to gauge how they were limiting productivity automatically, creativity (also auto based off of new ideas that day), ease of emotions, sense of dirextion,

Once idea is completed you can click on it and add reflections, which can be viewable in the creative idea next time around if reoccurrent. You will randomly be reminded daily of a random idea you achieved before as motivation. 

When making a creation, if you come upon the realization that you need to learn a topic, you can click add learn and type what subject you need to study.

Then, during study time, you can look at what you need to learn, find what seems interesting, and once you’ve learned what you’ve needed to satisfy the idea to reality you can complete it as a learned. When you leave notes during study, they go directly into the note section where the need to learn what made, adding to the discussion of the entry

This keeps learning purposeful and gives you a place to end (when you know enough to make it real). You won’t learn meaningless things or go to deep into rabbit holes on subjects. Only get the purpose out of the system for what yku need to make it work 





There will be a general stats page where you can

Your system concept is shaping up really well! It ties together time management, creative output, learning, and self-reflection in a very holistic way. Here are my thoughts on your updates:

The idea of starting with a small amount of creative expectation (e.g., 1 hour) and gradually increasing it until you’re dedicating most of your day to creative work is powerful. This progressive scaling helps people avoid burnout and gently builds creative discipline. The seriousness level serving as a governor for leisure time is a great motivator. This structure mirrors game design mechanics (like unlocking rewards), but in real life, it fuels the productive cycle.

Promoting time spent on meaningful creative work versus discouraging distractions is excellent for focusing attention and getting tangible results. By tracking progress and filtering out “useless” distractions, the system essentially acts as a productivity coach, ensuring that every moment contributes to something that has value.

The mental task manager that tracks thoughts, habits, and emotions is very insightful. It brings self-awareness into the system, showing the user how mental energy affects creative output and motivation. The emotional component helps people manage what’s internally holding them back, whether that’s negative emotions, distractions, or fatigue. It’s like monitoring your inner mental queue to prioritize tasks that will boost creativity. Reflecting on thoughts and emotions daily gives you a concrete way to pinpoint habits that need to be worked on.

The branching system that tracks time, effort, and progress toward creative ideas is clear, functional, and flexible. The ability to have broad or narrow categories gives users the freedom to shape it around their unique thought processes. I also love how you differentiate between recurrent ideas (like long-term projects) and one-time ideas. This makes it easier to plan for both the ongoing maintenance of things and the completion of short-term goals.

The learning system, where you add subjects as needed and keep it linked to the project, makes sure learning stays purpose-driven. It prevents wasting time on irrelevant learning while ensuring users absorb just enough to move forward. Notes linking directly back to the project or creative idea makes everything feel cohesive and part of the same flow. The learning is tied to creation, which prevents getting stuck in unnecessary rabbit holes.

The reflection feature lets users add their insights or thoughts after completing ideas. This adds depth, helping the user track not just progress but personal growth and lessons learned. Being reminded daily of past successes offers a sense of accomplishment and reinforces motivation, which can help build a positive feedback loop for creativity.

Overall, your system effectively transforms creative energy into real-life outcomes while balancing learning, reflection, and even leisure time. It turns productivity into a gamified process of self-discovery and improvement, structured in a way that aligns with natural human behavior (progressively unlocking challenges, balancing rest and work, and encouraging reflection).

How do you feel about expanding this system digitally, perhaps as an app that could track all of these factors? Or do you envision it more as a physical journaling/planning system?



This is an impressive and well-thought-out system! What you’ve created has the potential to serve as both a time management tool and a mental clarity system that bridges creativity, learning, and self-awareness. Here are some of the standout aspects and suggestions for further refinement:

Strengths:

	1.	Creative Idea Branch System:
	•	Hierarchical Tracking: The way each node in the system tracks both time and task completion is brilliant. By having child nodes’ time roll up to parent nodes, you create an overarching understanding of how much effort is going into the larger goal. This brings a sense of purpose to both small and large tasks, aligning all of them toward a broader vision.
	•	Recurrent vs. One-time Tasks: Splitting tasks into recurrent and one-time categories offers clarity in time management. Recurrent tasks (e.g., yard maintenance) show consistent effort over time, while one-time tasks help to track the completion of projects.
	•	Visualization of Progress: The color coding (yellow for in-process and green for completed) makes it easy to see where you stand in any particular project. This visual feedback would make it satisfying to see ideas transition from “in progress” to “completed.”
	2.	Idea Diary & Time Tracking:
	•	This acts as a visual diary, allowing you to log ideas, the time spent on them, and their progression. It’s more than just a task manager—it’s a creative record that shows the evolution of ideas from inception to reality. By revisiting this history, you’ll gain insights into what worked and what could improve.
	3.	Creative Energy Management & Rest:
	•	I love the idea of earning time for passive activities like watching TV or browsing after you’ve put creative focus into a project. This makes you more conscious of your distractions and intentional about balancing relaxation with productivity.
	•	The practice of sitting still and allowing creative ideas to flow naturally rather than diving into distractions is key for maintaining long-term mental health and productivity. This aligns well with mindfulness and avoiding burnout.
	4.	Mental Task Manager:
	•	This part is genius. Having a mental task manager to track off-focused thoughts (emotions, habits, distractions) adds a layer of self-awareness and accountability. By logging how much time is spent on distracting thoughts or emotions and comparing it to creative time, you gain a better understanding of what’s limiting you.
	•	Emotional Tracking: The idea of tracking emotions to understand their impact on productivity and creativity is extremely valuable. It helps visualize the emotional load versus creative output. Over time, this could offer profound insights into your emotional triggers and patterns.
	5.	Automated Insights:
	•	The system you’ve devised, especially the automatic comparison between time spent on creative ideas and emotional states, provides a smart way to measure your efficiency. It allows you to see patterns that might go unnoticed otherwise.

Areas for Further Development:

	1.	Tracking the Learning Phase:
	•	You mention that there will be time to learn in between creating, but how will you track learning specifically? It could be useful to add a section to log what you’re learning, whether it’s through reading, watching videos, or other forms of education. This could be added as a separate category like “Learning Ideas” where you track progress in acquiring new skills or knowledge.
	2.	Reflection:
	•	A reflection phase could be added to the system where, after each completed task, you log insights about what you learned from the task. This would give you a continuous loop of improvement by refining your process based on past experiences.
	3.	Incentives for Long-Term Engagement:
	•	To keep yourself motivated over time, you might want to consider adding a reward system. For instance, once certain milestones are hit (e.g., 10 ideas successfully manifested), you earn a reward that could reinforce positive behavior. This would ensure that the system feels engaging and rewarding in the long run.
	4.	Idea Ranking:
	•	You could introduce a way to rank or prioritize ideas based on impact or passion. Not all ideas are equal in importance, so having a way to measure which ideas are most aligned with your goals could be useful.
	5.	Community Feedback:
	•	Once you’ve developed your system, you could potentially add a collaborative layer. Sharing your system with others and receiving feedback could lead to even more improvement and fine-tuning. It might even evolve into something useful for others on their own creative journeys.

Overall Thoughts:

This system shows a deep understanding of how creativity, mental clarity, and energy management work together. It’s not just about making tasks and getting things done; it’s about balancing the flow of creativity with real-world progress, and doing it in a way that promotes long-term growth and well-being. The inclusion of emotions, distractions, and mental energy management alongside practical task tracking is what makes this system holistic and unique.

Once you finalize and start using this, it has the potential to become a personal operating system for how you approach life and creativity. Keep refining it, and it could serve as a powerful tool to bring all your ideas to fruition. Would you like to explore how to potentially build this into a digital app or a tracking template?




Think out each step and write steps inside of steps if needed 

It will be a piece of paper with writing of all the different pieces of the system, and an overview of how it all works together. Also a why each thing is there and needed in the system 

If you create a creative plan with a date and you don’t do what you planned or do do it, it’s considered 

Also if you go back and do creative ideas you missed on previous days

The higher all of these are, the lower your daily score is. The daily score will be compared to the creative ideas you did that day (and your reported mental queue) to measure what ideas lead to what feelings, and also to see how these feelings interact with your productivity levels/what activities they make you prone to do.
This will help you navigate what thoughts/feelings are productive towards certain creative ideas, which thoughts/feelings overall are creating bad load and need to be ignored, and how your mind reacts to fulfilling different creative ideas so you can judge when to do certain ideas in certain moods, 


This is a fascinating concept for a system that ties together emotional states, productivity, and creative output. By quantifying mental distractions and emotional states like laziness, procrastination, doubt, and ill-will, and correlating them with the ideas you’ve engaged with and your productivity, you’re building a framework that could give deep insights into how certain moods or mental states affect creative work.

Here’s how this could evolve:

	1.	Daily Score System: Track levels of laziness, procrastination, distraction, and doubt. Maybe you could also rate these on a sliding scale or create metrics that capture them based on user input or behavior. These would feed into a daily score that reflects your overall mental/emotional state.
	2.	Idea Tracking and Mental Task Queue: As you act on creative ideas throughout the day, you record the ideas in a queue system. You can track when ideas are started, completed, or shelved. Alongside each idea, you can note the mood, emotional state, or resistance level when working on it. This helps create a correlation between mental state and idea execution.
	3.	Interaction Analysis: Over time, the system will gather enough data to identify patterns. For example, if your score for “doubt” or “restlessness” is high, and that correlates with abandoned or incomplete ideas, the system could suggest focusing on low-risk or low-stakes tasks during such times. Similarly, if “seeking pleasure” correlates with more creativity but less productivity, you could plan your most creative tasks during that mood.
	4.	Recommendation Engine: Once patterns are identified, the system can make suggestions on which tasks or creative ideas to pursue based on your emotional or mental state. For example, if you tend to have lower doubt or procrastination when you first wake up, it might suggest tackling your most important or challenging tasks early in the day.
	5.	Mindfulness Feedback: By reflecting on the emotional load certain ideas or states create, you could develop strategies to consciously manage or ignore unproductive states. The system could help reinforce positive emotional cues while giving you insight into which thoughts lead to distractions or less productive periods.
	6.	Visualization and Reports: A visual dashboard could map out how different moods and mental loads affect your creative process, making it easier to see what actions led to more productive or creative periods. Over time, you’d be able to optimize how you approach tasks based on your natural tendencies.

Your system could act like a personal guide, showing how emotional and mental states interact with creativity, productivity, and even motivation. It would offer an invaluable tool for gaining more self-awareness and aligning work with your best mental states.

Db handling values, removing nodes 
Second db to handle trades
Click title and schedule to manage on front end
Flip tree graphics
Each value has name, value, and inheritable bool. If inheritable is true (check mark next to value on front end) then all children will receive the value like hrs in root. Can be turned off in further generations so it stops if you don’t need to track further 


Type nodes (graphing, crypto wallet, git)
Type db
Login in cookies 

Values must be positive
Loss branches
Create new tree or branch off others (note you will not be able to see the main tree unless you have access, but they will see you and your node can be removed by owner of root at any time. You can also leave and make tree at any time 
Owner can remove forks and make them root

+ create first tree 


Nodes inherit parent values set to 0 on creation 

Just need to add in goals, global values(toggle version values),), and schedule.schedule I already built just have to move old code into react components

When deleting root ask you are owner and you have contributors. Choose a new person to own
Send contributions when inviting someone, uninviting (whether be forced by owner or self) and changing owner 


Make sure person being assigned owner is a contributor

Removing roots
If contributor, you leave 
If owner and contributors, must choose new person from contributors
If owner and no contributors remove root reference from user
Set root owner to trimmed


Can’t create node or edit tree if not a contributor or owner 

Tutorial 


Tree: root node macro goal. Sets context for trees purpose

Each node built off of another is a further goal or step to break down its parents goal into a further plan of action , with number values that can be used to track, goals to set ideals based off values, a note section to write ideas, plan, track progress, upload photos and videos, and write reflections. A scheduler that lets you set the schedule time for the goal, and see the schedule of all the children branches. A transaction log that shows all actions that have been done on the goal


Build goals out into more refined steps by creating children with further planning.

Every node should have its parent in mind to keep goals on course 

For goals that are one and done, click complete goal when done, but others need to repeat once completed. For that, we use prestige.

When you prestige a node, it adds a new layer, completing the last level and starting fresh with new active status, reset values and goals, new notes, and new scheduling. Every prestige generation is accounted for when passing the data to the root. 

Set Reefrect time to automatically reschedule a prestige node on prestiging. For example, if it’s a daily task set it to 24hrs.

Remember to write a reflection before prestiging or completing a node for later insight, but you can always go back and edit previous prestige’s.



Crediting from branches 

Yes, this makes sense and outlines a structured, comprehensive system for goal-setting and tracking. Here’s a clearer summary to ensure the flow and purpose of the system are understood:
	1.	Tree Structure & Purpose:
	•	Root Node: Represents the overarching “macro goal” and sets the context for the tree’s purpose.
	•	Child Nodes: Break down the parent node’s goal into smaller, actionable steps, creating a hierarchical plan of action.
	2.	Node Features:
Each node includes:
	•	Values: Numerical metrics to track progress.
	•	Goals: Ideals or targets informed by the node’s values.
	•	Notes Section: For ideas, progress updates, photos/videos, and reflections.
	•	Scheduler: To set times for the goal and view schedules of child branches.
	•	Transaction Log: Records all actions and updates related to the node.
	3.	Planning & Refinement:
	•	Goals are refined by creating child nodes, ensuring alignment with the parent’s purpose.
	•	Keeps the tree focused and coherent.
	4.	Completing Goals:
	•	For “one-and-done” tasks: Mark the goal as complete when finished.
	•	For recurring tasks: Use Prestige.
	5.	Prestige System:
	•	Purpose: Refresh a recurring goal, completing the current level while starting a new cycle.
	•	Process: Resets values, goals, notes, and scheduling while maintaining a record of previous cycles.
	•	Reflection: Encourages users to reflect on the current cycle before resetting, with the option to revisit past records.
	•	Rescheduling: Use “Reefrect” to auto-schedule the next cycle (e.g., 24 hours for a daily task).

This system is both practical and reflective, allowing users to focus on actionable steps while learning from past iterations. It’s great for tracking progress, maintaining alignment with overarching goals, and improving through repeated cycles.

Circle of validation 

Just being free of any seeking
(Like a kid)

Point of no return


External (gathering phase)
Seeking validation approval or purpose
Trying to make others approve of you

Internal (refinement phase)
Meaning within self’s guided by personal values 
Grow tired of chasing others approval, and develop your own validation system based off of all that you picked up. Develop a personalized character to take a path in life

Acceptance/being
Don’t need  seek value/validation. It’s made by you, and unnecessary workings of the mind. Escape mind trap, and drop need for any validation. All chases for value are point of view fabrications and an unnecessary endeavor. The only condition to happiness sis freedom. Craving
